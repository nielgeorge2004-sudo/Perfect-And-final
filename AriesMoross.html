        <p class="mt-4">Aries Moross works as a designer, artist, and creative director. Moross started their career in 2007 by creating hand-drawn flyers for the independent music scene in London. In 2008, they started a record label that exclusively released vinyl records. They established Studio Moross in 2012 because they were eager to grow their practice and assemble a staff.

        They have remained closely associated with the music industry throughout their career, but they have also ventured into the fields of art and creative direction.


        With projects ranging from album promotions to live performances, Moross has served as creative director for a variety of clients, including pop acts and DJs. Notable customers include London Grammar, Jessie Ware, Spice Girls, Disclosure, H.E.R., and Kylie Minogue.</p>
